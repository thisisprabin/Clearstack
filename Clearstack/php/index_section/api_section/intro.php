This is a php api is contain number of functions with in class which can help to complete your work with in very easy way.<br>
Before using this api there two questions may be occur - <br>
<br>
1. Why should I use it because coding in php is already easy ?<br>
2. How to use it.<br>
<br>
The answer of the second question is provided on the lines given on the left side. Let me answer the first question.<br>
Why should I use it ? For an example making a database connection in a proper way we need to write 7 to 8 lines of code.

What if these code is already provided in class all you need to do is - <br> 
* Include that class.<br> 
* Make an Object.<br>
* Call the function.<br>
* And your work is done with in two lines. So this api can help you to minimize your code.<br>
